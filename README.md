## Snap Packages

_Update 2024-03-04:_ Temporary unmaintained since those currently aren't used anymore in the local setup/environment.

Published to the [Snapcraft store](https://snapcraft.io/) (right now privately/unlisted).

- HashiCorp [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/)
- HashiCorp [Consul](https://www.consul.io/)

_Note:_ Canonical provides a HashiCorp [Vault snap package](https://snapcraft.io/vault), so no need to build/create it.

## Docker Images

Docker images are pushed/published to GitHub packages (the ghcr.io registry) within this repository.

- A modified [HomeAssistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) version that can be run as non-root user
- A [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) server bundling multiple plugins and the possibility to run against port 80 and 443 as non-root user
- A minimal act runner environment with Python 3 installed
- A modified [Homebridge](https://homebridge.io) version that has already a couple of plugins build in so it can be run in a read-only filesystem with a non-root user on privileged ports.
- A custom [Node-RED](https://nodered.org) version that has already a couple of plugins build in so it can be run in a read-only filesystem with a non-root user on privileged ports.

## Scripts

Some scripts that automate frequently conducted tasks.

## Setup

On macOS run the following command to install just:

```shell
brew install just
```

For other operating systems, have a look at the installation section in the [just documentation](https://github.com/casey/just/tree/df8eabb3ef705e0807b863db2a0c99061f691bbe#packages=).

Subsequently, set up the repository:

```shell
# 1) install the required tooling: the install step uses brew and therefore works only on macos;
# on other operation systems check the needed tools in the justfile.shared and install these manually
just install
# 2) initialize the tooling
just init
```

## Development

For a list of available commands, just run `just` within the git repository.

Use [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) to run the GitHub Actions CI flow locally.
